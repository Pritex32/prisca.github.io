# Projects
## [Gurgaon,india House Prediction](Pritex32/Gurgoan-house-price-prediction (github.com))                      Sep 21,2024
- For this data, i used features such as  price, price_per_sqft, bedRoom, balcony, to analyze and predict house prices in Gurgaon.
- which helps assess risks associated with property investments. it enhances efficiency by automating the price prediction process, allowing for quicker responses in fast-paced markets. predictive models contribute to a better understanding of economic conditions through housing trends.
- Data cleaning steps involving  removing null values and handling duplicates.Outliers in features like balcony, bedRoom, price_per_sqft, and price were treated using interquartile range (IQR) method.
-	Linear Regression was initially used but gave a score of 0.52, showing moderate performance.
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) models were also tested.
- KNN performed best, with a training score of 0.88 and a test score of 0.72.
-	Tools used: Pandas,Python,Sklearn,Matplotlib, Seaborn

## [Bank-Customer Prediction]( Pritex32/pritex_project (github.com))                                             Sep 13,2024
This dataset is about determining the customers who wants to leave the bank and those who doesâ€™nt. To solve this problem, I developed a model with ANN algorithm to be able to predict these customers before they leave the bank so that the company can take appropriate measures.
- Developed an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict customers at risk of leaving the bank, achieving 98% accuracy and a test score of 94%.
-	Preprocessed the dataset by handling missing values and outliers, improving model reliability.
-	Implemented a feature selection process, reducing the feature set by 30%, which improved computation speed by 20%.
-	The model helps the company take timely action, leading to a potential increase in customer retention by 15%.
-	Tools: Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Keras.

## [Lung Cancer Prediction and Analysis ](https://github.com/Pritex32/lung-cancer-prediction)                                Sep 26, 2024

3 models were built in order to choose the model that best fit the prediction.
- Random Forest (Accuracy: 99.5% on training set, 85.7% on test set). Naive Bayes (Accuracy: 86.8% on
training set, 83.9% on test set). Logistic Regression (Accuracy: 91.8% on training set, 83.9% on test set).
- Logistic Regression was chosen due to its performance and fit in the training set and validation set .
- Logistic Regression was chosen as the final model, considered to fit well for lung cancer detection.
- The model aims to assist hospitals or individuals in detecting early-stage lung cancer, potentially preventing
worse outcomes .
- The model will enable the employees to easily check and admit lung cancer patient by inputing few features
into the model.
- If the model were to be deployed to individuals, it will enable individuals to quickly check and monitor their
health .
- Library Used: Pandas,matplotlib,Seaborn,sklearn
