# Projects
## [Gurgaon,india House Prediction](Pritex32/Gurgoan-house-price-prediction (github.com))                      Sep 21,2024
- For this data, i used features such as  price, price_per_sqft, bedRoom, balcony, to analyze and predict house prices in Gurgaon.
- which helps assess risks associated with property investments. it enhances efficiency by automating the price prediction process, allowing for quicker responses in fast-paced markets. predictive models contribute to a better understanding of economic conditions through housing trends.
- Data cleaning steps involving  removing null values and handling duplicates.Outliers in features like balcony, bedRoom, price_per_sqft, and price were treated using interquartile range (IQR) method.
-	Linear Regression was initially used but gave a score of 0.52, showing moderate performance.
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) models were also tested.
- KNN performed best, with a training score of 0.88 and a test score of 0.72.
-	Tools used: Pandas,Python,Sklearn,Matplotlib, Seaborn

## [Bank-Customer Prediction]( Pritex32/pritex_project (github.com))                                             Sep 13,2024
This dataset is about determining the customers who wants to leave the bank and those who doesâ€™nt. To solve this problem, I developed a model with ANN algorithm to be able to predict these customers before they leave the bank so that the company can take appropriate measures.
- Developed an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict customers at risk of leaving the bank, achieving 98% accuracy and a test score of 94%.
-	Preprocessed the dataset by handling missing values and outliers, improving model reliability.
-	Implemented a feature selection process, reducing the feature set by 30%, which improved computation speed by 20%.
-	The model helps the company take timely action, leading to a potential increase in customer retention by 15%.
-	Tools: Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Keras.

## [Lung Cancer Prediction and Analysis ](https://github.com/Pritex32/lung-cancer-prediction)                                Sep 26, 2024

The goal of this project is to develop customer segmentation to define a marketing strategy 
based on the behavior of around 9000 active credit card holders over the last six months. The dataset contains 18 behavioral variables.
Each cluster is analyzed based on mean values of selected features:
-	Cluster 0: High balance, infrequent purchases, and frequent advance payments. Contributes 7.4% to company sales.
-	Cluster 1: Highest purchases, frequent transactions, main source of company sales, but no advance payments.
-	Cluster 2: Moderate purchases, contributes 25.2% to sales, low credit limit, and no advance payments.
-	Cluster 3: Lowest balance and purchases, infrequent transactions, 5.1% contribution to sales.
#### Recommendation:	
-	For Clusters 0 and 3: will encourage purchases through discounts, promotions, and personalized marketing communications.
-	For Clusters 1 and 2: company should Increase their credit limits and offer bonuses to stimulate more spending.
